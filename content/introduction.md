Hi there, welcome to my github.io website!

I post random notes and tutorials to this website. Anything that I feel could be helpful for future me or others.

This site also uses a tiny client-side framework that I made which directly parses markdown files from [my github.io repository](https://github.com/ericytsang/ericytsang.github.io) and serves them straight to you!
